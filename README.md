# Amstrad PC
Amstrad PC -- A fork of the *JavaCPC* emulator


## Copyright
This is a modified work based on JavaCPC (Based on Jemu)

JEMU originally by Richard Wilson (http://jemu.winape.net)

Enhanced Emulator Version 6.5 by Markus Hohmann (http://cpc-live.com)

JavaCPC is distributed under the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://github.com/jandebr/amstradPc/blob/main/LICENSE) and so is this work


## Modifications
This work is a 100% Java software that builds on the core JavaCPC and provides features including

- An integrated program browser

- Instant loading and saving of Basic source code

- Quick access to program info, e.g. user controls in a game (depending on available metadata)

- Text-based program metadata files

- A much simplified menu bar, in sync with the API

- Minor fixes to JavaCPC (e.g., fullscreen, pause mode)

- An easy API for integrators, see the class [AmstradPc](https://github.com/jandebr/amstradPc/blob/main/src/org/maia/amstrad/pc/AmstradPc.java)
