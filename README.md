## Getting started

To get started

1. Download the project sources from [github](https://github.com/jandebr/amstradPc)
2. From the parent directory, run `java -Djava.library.path=system/jinput -jar dist/amstradPc.jar`

Alternatively, one can distribute *Amstrad PC* to end user computers using [getdown](https://github.com/threerings/getdown) as detailed in the [distribution](https://github.com/jandebr/amstradPc/wiki/Distribute-using-getdown) documentation

A *getdown distribution* may ship with a (managed) collection of Basic program files. It is *managed* so not intended to make local changes as these will get overridden upon update

To setup your own (local) program collection, see the [repository](https://github.com/jandebr/amstradPc/wiki/Program-repository) documentation
